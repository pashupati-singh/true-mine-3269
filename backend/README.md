# Server introduction:

Our E-Commerce Website Backend is the backbone of our online shopping experience, handling critical operations and ensuring smooth functionality. It serves as the engine that powers product management, user authentication, order processing, and more. With its robust architecture and scalable design, our backend ensures a seamless shopping experience for both customers and administrators. The Backend API is designed to manage the Product and User. It allows clients to read the products through HTTP requests.

## Architecture:

The backend follows a three-tier architecture:

### Presentation Layer: Accepts HTTP requests and communicates with the Application Layer.

### Application Layer: Handles business logic and interacts with the Data Access Layer.

### Data Access Layer: Manages interactions with the database.

## Key Features:

- _Product Management:_ Effortlessly add, update, and remove products from the catalog. Categorize and organize products for easy discovery.

- _User Authentication:_ Secure user registration and authentication to ensure a safe shopping environment. Allow customers to manage their profiles and track their order history.

- _Shopping Cart_ and Checkout: Enable customers to add products to their cart, proceed to checkout, and complete their purchases securely.

- _Order Processing:_ Efficiently handle order fulfillment, shipment tracking, and payment processing for a seamless customer experience.

- _Inventory Management:_ Track product availability, stock levels, and handle restocking processes.

- _Discounts and Promotions:_ Implement special offers, discounts, and promotional campaigns to attract and retain customers.

- _Reporting and Analytics:_ Generate valuable insights through data-driven reports, helping administrators make informed decisions and optimize business strategies.

## Technologies:

Our backend leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver exceptional performance and maintainability:

- _Node.js:_ A versatile and efficient JavaScript runtime that powers our server-side logic.

- _Express.js:_ A flexible and lightweight web application framework that facilitates the development of robust APIs.

- _MongoDB:_ A powerful NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- _Mongoose:_ An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool that simplifies data manipulation and validation.

- _JSON Web Tokens (JWT):_ Securely manage user authentication and authorization.

- _Bcrypt:_ Securely manage user-sensitive data.

- _RESTful API:_ We follow REST principles to build an intuitive and predictable API.

- _Custom middleware:_ A user authentication middleware for Node.js that ensures secure and customizable authentication.
